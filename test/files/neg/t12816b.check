B.scala:19: warning: reference to c is ambiguous;
it is both defined in the enclosing package p and inherited in the enclosing trait RR as method c (defined in trait T)
In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.c`.
Or use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning.
