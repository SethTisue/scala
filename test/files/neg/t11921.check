t11921.scala:6: warning: reference to coll is ambiguous;
it is both defined in the enclosing method lazyMap and inherited in the enclosing anonymous class as method coll (defined in trait Iterable)
In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.coll`.
Or use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning.
      def iterator = coll.iterator.map(f)    // coll is ambiguous
                     ^
