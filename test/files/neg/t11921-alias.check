t11921-alias.scala:18: warning: reference to TT is ambiguous;
it is both defined in the enclosing object O and inherited in the enclosing class D as type TT (defined in class C)
In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.TT`.
Or use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning.

In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.c`.

In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.

In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.name`.
